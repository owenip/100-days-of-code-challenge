The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on September 14, Friday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1: September 14, 2018 
**Today's Progress:** Started an Angular 6 course as well as the 100 days of code challenge. Learnt the basic of Component: Angular component decorator   
**Thoughts:** Decorator provides configuration metadata that determines how the component should be processed, instantiated, and used at runtime. For more detail, [Angular - Component Documentation](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)   
**Link to Work:** N/A

### Day 2: September 15, 2018 
**Today's Progress:** Learnt How to implement a new component in Angular6.
**Thoughts:** Using Angular CLI is a much faster way to add new component.   
**Link to Work:** N/A (Only add a new component to a demo project. Not worth to create a repo to upload)
